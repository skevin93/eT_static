Example for external project in cmake.

To use for your external library, change all the external_lib (notice it vary from uppercase to lowercase)
with a prefered name, rename the file to `Find<library_name>.cmake` and put in the cmake files directory.

`<library_name>` is the library name you choose.

To call it in CMakeLists.txt use `find_package(<library_name>)`
